  <p><strong>üìò</strong> Git and Github
A quick aside: <em>git</em> and <em>Github</em> are <strong>not</strong> the same things. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux OS; Github is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need Github to use git, but you cannot use Github without using git. There are many other alternatives to Github, such as GitLab, BitBucket,‚Ä¶ You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-create-a-local-git-repository-">Step 1: Create a local git repository <a name="step1"></a></h2>

<p>When creating new project on your local machine using git, you‚Äôll first create a new repositori (repo). To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on you local machine. Then, run init command:</p>

<div class="code-header">
	<button class="copy-code-button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard"></button>
</div>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">name@ubuntu:~$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">cd </span>myproject/
<span class="gp">name@ubuntu:~$</span><span class="w"> </span>git init
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="step-2-add-a-new-file-to-the-repository-">Step 2: Add a new file to the repository <a name="step2"></a></h2>

<p>Go ahead and add some files in the folder. Once you have added or modified files in a folder containing a git repoo, git will notice that the file exists inside the repo. But, git won‚Äôt track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files that it tracks, so we will need to send a command to confirm that yes, want git to track our new file.</p>

<div class="code-header">
	<button class="copy-code-button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard"></button>
</div>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">name@ubuntu:~$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">touch </span>file01.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can git status command to see which files git knows exist</p>

<div class="code-header">

  <h5 id="an-interlude-the-staging-environment-the-commit-and-you">An interlude: the staging environment, the commit, and you</h5>

  <p>One of the most confusing parts when you‚Äôre first learning git is the concept of the stagin environment and how it relates to a commit.<br />
A <em><strong>commit</strong></em> is a record of what changes you have made since the last time you made a commit. Commits make up the essence of your project and allow you to jump to the state of a project at any other commit. So, how do you tell git which files to put into a commit? This is where the staging environment or index come in. In Step 2, when you make changes to your repo, git notices that a file has changed but won‚Äôt do anything with it.<br />
To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the <em>git add &lt; filename &gt;</em> command. One you‚Äôve used git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the <em>git commit</em> command.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="step-3-add-a-file-to-the-staging-environment-">Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment <a name="step3"></a></h2>

<p>Add a file to the staging environment using the git add command. if you rerun the git status command you will see that git has added the file to the staging environment.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-create-a-commit-">Step 4: Create a commit <a name="step4"></a></h2>

<p>Run the command <em>git commit -m ‚Äúyour message‚Äù</em>. The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it‚Äôs a new feature, maybe it‚Äôs a bug fix, maybe it‚Äôs just fixing a typo. Commits live forever in a repository (technically you can delete them if you really, really need to but it‚Äôs messy), so if you leave a clear explanation of your changes it can be extremely helpful for future programmers (perhaps future you!) who are trying to figure out why some change was made years later.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-create-a-new-branch-">Step 5: Create a new branch <a name="step5"></a></h2>
<p>Say you want to make a new feature but are worried about making changes to the main project while developing the feature. This is where git branches come in.</p>

<p>Branches allow you to move back and forth between ‚Äòstates‚Äô of a project. Official git docs describe branches this way: ‚ÄòA branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.‚Äô For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. Once you‚Äôre done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the primary branch. When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch ‚Äòbranched‚Äô off of, so it knows the history behind all the files.</p>
