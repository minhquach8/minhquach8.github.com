<p>Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as ‚Äúa simple, blog aware, static site generator‚Äù.

<h1 id="what-does-jekyll-do-">What does Jekyll do? <a name="section2"></a></h1>

<p>Jekyll is installed as a ruby gem local computer. Once installed you can call jekyll serve in the terminal in a directory and provided that directory is setup in a way jekyll expects, it will do magic stuff like parse markdown/textile files, compute categories, tags, permalinks, and construct your pages from layout templates and partials.</p>

<p>Once parsed, Jekyll stores the result in a self-contained static _site folder. The intention here is that you can serve all contents in this folder statically from a plain static web-server.</p>

<p>You can think of Jekyll as a normalish dynamic blog but rather than parsing content, templates, and tags on each request, Jekyll does this once beforehand and caches the entire website in a folder for serving statically.</p>

<h1 id="jekyll-is-not-blogging-software">Jekyll is Not Blogging Software.<a name="section3"></a></h1>

<p><strong>Jekyll is a parsing engine.</strong></p>

<p>Jekyll does not come with any content nor does it have any templates or design elements. This is a common source of confusion when getting started. Jekyll does not come with anything you actually use or see on your website - you have to make it.</p>

<h1 id="why-should-i-use-jekyll-">Why should I use Jekyll? <a name="section4"></a></h1>

<p>Jekyll is very minimalistic and very efficient. The most important thing to realize about Jekyll is that it creates a static representation of your website requiring only a static web-server. Traditional dynamic blogs like Wordpress require a database and server-side code. Heavily trafficked dynamic blogs must employ a caching layer that ultimately performs the same job Jekyll sets out to do; serve static content.</p>

<p>Therefore if you like to keep things simple and you prefer the command-line over an admin panel UI then give Jekyll a try.</p>

<p><strong>Developers like Jekyll because we can write content like we write code:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.</li>
  <li>Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.</li>
  <li>No internet connection required.</li>
  <li>Ability to publish via git.</li>
  <li>Ability to host your blog on a static web-server.</li>
  <li>Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.</li>
  <li>No database required.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="installation-">Installation <a name="section5"></a></h1>

<p>First you need to install ruby on your machine. You can download it from this <a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-2.7.0-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-2.7.0-1-x64.exe">site</a> for (x64) and <a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-2.7.0-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-2.7.0-1-x86.exe">site</a> for (x86) (These sites are for Windows).</p>
