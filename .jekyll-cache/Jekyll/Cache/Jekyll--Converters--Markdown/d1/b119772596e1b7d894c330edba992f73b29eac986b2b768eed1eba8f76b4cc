<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ðŸ“˜</strong> Git and Github
A quick aside: <em>git</em> and <em>Github</em> are <strong>not</strong> the same things. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux OS; Github is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need Github to use git, but you cannot use Github without using git. There are many other alternatives to Github, such as GitLab, BitBucket,â€¦ You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.</p>

  <blockquote>
    But web browsers arenâ€™t like web servers. If your back-end code is getting so big that itâ€™s starting to run noticably slowly, you can throw more computing power at it by scaling up your server. Thatâ€™s not an option on the front-end where you donâ€™t really have <em>one</em> run-time environmentâ€”your end users have their own run-time environment with its own constraints around computing power <strong>and</strong> network connectivity.
